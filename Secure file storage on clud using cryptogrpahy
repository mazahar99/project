Abstract :- The data security on cloud can be achieved as
            1.)Divide the data into chunks.
            2.)Store each and every chunk of data on cloud by making use of AES(Advanced Encrytion Standards Algorithm)
Data Encryption Standards(DES) :- block cipher
                                  plain text and the cipher text would be of same length
                                  64 bit block cipher
                                  uses a particular key inorder to encrypt and decrypt
Advanced Data Encryption Standards(AES) :- subset of Rijndael Cipher
                                           a.)Byte Substitution
                                           b.)Shift Rows
                                           c.)Mix columns
                                           d.)Add Round Key
                                           For the sake of decryption the entire steps are to be followed in reverse way.
Conclusion :- Hence, by making use of this mechanism we can store the encrypted data securely in cloud.
